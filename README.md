```

2. **Insert later**

### Data Setup
The data file is not tracked by Git. If you want to work with this repo you should:
1. Obtain the dataset from Digital Futures
2. Place the `Life Expectancy Data.csv` file in the `data/` folder

## Models
* Model 1: A data sensitive model
* Model 2: A data insensitive model

## Results
* Best Model 1 accuracy: [TBD]
* Best Model 2 accuracy: [TBD]
* Key findings: [TBD]
